Storage for BIG data
====================

| Rich collection
| of Earth Observation data
|

| An integral part of our public cloud is access to one of Europe's largest repositories for Earth observation data.

| **Data collections from satellites available from our cloud platform:**

**- Copernicus**:

    | - Sentinel-1 (Radar),
    | - Sentinel-2 (Optical, multispectral),
    | - Sentinel-3 (Meteorological),
    | - Sentinel-5p (Spectroscopic - atmosphere composition),
    | - Landsat,
    | - Envisat,
    | - Copernicus Services.

|
| **VHR (Very High Resolution)** data is provided by satellites from China and Kazakhstan. Very High Resolution products are available on a commercial basis and are available as:

    | - Images from the archive
    | - New tasking images
    | - Video clips on 4K resolution

|

| The data in our repository is available locally, directly from our public cloud, and is additionally enriched with a wide set of interfaces (object-oriented S3, file NFS, geospatial OGC WMS/WMTS).
| They are accessed almost immediately after being acquired from satellites (in the case of Copernicus and Landsat) - automatically downloaded minutes after publication and indexed. Currently, there are about **16 PB of observation data** available. The repository is growing by **20TB** on average every day.

| Thanks to platforms such as `CREODIAS <https://creodias.eu/>`_ and `WEkEO <https://www.wekeo.eu/>`_ provided by us, there is no need to make investments and build your own infrastructure or download data to external processing platforms.
